Gearbag
=======

A little exercise in using MooTools as well as the iFixit API.

Using
-----
Items can be dragged from the items pane to the "gearbag" on the right.
Contents of the gearbag are saved in a browser database (works in Chrome).
To remove items from the bag, just drag them back to the item pane. 

Areas Demo
----------
The areas subfolder uses a different part of the API to get devices by category,
rather than by alphabetical position. It is not fully implemented in that it does
not load device image when place into the gearbag.

Users
-----
Again, different API area. Same format as the gearbag, but you can drag iFixit.com
users into the bag.
